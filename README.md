# bratushkadan's dotfiles

## Dotfiles Arrangement

Dotfiles are managed via GNU Stow ‚Äì the "symlink farm manager". Its largest benefit is seamless integration with VCS that allows one to set it up once and reach **only** for the `git commit/push` command if there's a need to change configuration. That's it, once it's configured it just works.

Initializing symlinks is dead simple:

1. `git clone git@github.com:bratushkadan/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles && cd ~/dotfiles`
2. `stow .`

### dependencies

- git
- stow (included in this repo's Brewfile)

## [MacOS / OSX](./setup/macos/README.md)

### [Brew / BrewFile](./setup/macos/README.md#brew--brewfile)

## Tools

### nvim

#### Plugins

Describe here the plugin update/installation process.

#### Telescope plugin

`brew install ripgrep` - DO NOT install `fd` simultaneously with `rg`, precedence seems to be `fd` > `rg`, Telescope bugs out and `pickers.find_files.hidden = true` option no longer shows hidden files/directories :(
Upd Jan 29, 2025 - no longer relevant, but be cautious.

### `tmux` - terminal multiplexer

#### Steps to set up

1. (‚úÖ installed automatically via brew) Install [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

2. (‚úÖ configuration is symlinked via Stow) Run `mv .tmux.conf ~/` from the repository's root;
3. Run `tmux` and press `C-a + I` (capital I, after keys rebound) to install plugins;
